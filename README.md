Advanced Medication Manager for Home Assistant


I made this manager for myself and my lovely partner to keep track on medication schedule and to receive reordering reminders. Complex schedule was hard to track with any available application I came across and I knew it was possible with amazing Home Assistant.

**The goal of this project (Features):**
1. Keep track on available amount of many different medication pills
2. Reminder as Android notification when it's time to take medication (Optional)
3. Remidner as Android Alarm when it's time to take medication (Optional)
4. e-mail reminder when it's time to reorder medication (Optional)
5. Simple GUI - Home Assistant Dashboard

**Important Note:**

I did this in my free time for myself with big help from Home Assistant Community (awesome people). I'm happy to share, it might be useful to some of you, feel free to modify it, reshare, whatever you want..but keep in mind I'm not a pro developer and I'm still new with coding and Home Assistant. You might find this weird because I made a custom ecosystem using packages in HA. You have to follow few simple rules to make it work, but its only for initial setup and then only when you are changing schedule. I hope it will be easy to understand after this readme. 

!!! It is your job to take care about your own medication, I take no responsibility in any regard! If you need super stable application don't use this manager, find something else! Learn your medication schedule by heart and try to never skip or forget about your meds, use this manager as a last resort of information you rely on.
I'm using this manager for some time now and its working perfectly fine for me. I don't expect many bugs, but I'll try to update if I find any. Also, feel free to make any suggestions, I'm sure many things could be done in much better way.
