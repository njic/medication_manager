Advanced Medication Manager for Home Assistant


I made this manager for myself and my lovely partner to keep track on medication schedule and to receive reminders for reordering. Complex schedule was hard to track with any available application I came across and I knew it should be possible with amazing Home Assistant.

**The goal of this project (Features):**
1. Keep track on available amount of many different medication pills
2. Reminder as Android notification when it's time to take medication (Optional)
3. Remidner as Android Alarm when it's time to take medication (Optional)
4. e-mail reminder when it's time to reorder medication (Optional)
5. Simple GUI - Home Assistant Dashboard

**Important Note:**
I did this for myself with big help from Home Assistant Community (awesome people). I'm happy to share, it might be useful to some of you, feel free to modify it, reshare, whatever you want..but keep in mind I'm not a real developer and I'm still new to coding and Home Assistant. You might find this weird because I made a custom ecosystem using packages in HA.
